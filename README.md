# Digipedia Version 2

I wanted a site where i could look up basic info about a digimon and see it's digievolution possibilies as a simple list of images. When I didn't fin one that pleased me I made my own! This is version 2 of the project, with navigation and routing added, and a more component based structure.

## Project structure

It's very simple!

← `README.md`: That’s this file

← `index.html`: The main page template for React

← `src/app.jsx`: All the digipedia code and tailwind css

← `tailwind.config.js`: Custom rules for tailwind css, tho currently there are none.

**Feel free to Remix the project if you wish to make it your own!**
