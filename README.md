# Digipedia Version 2

I wanted a site where i could look up basic info about a digimon and see it's digivolution possibilies as a simple list of images. When I didn't find one that pleased me I made my own! This is version 2 of the project, with navigation and routing added, and a more component based structure compared to version 1.

This project was built in glitch.com
